= Test middleware

This is a demo middleware designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the https://github.com/unblu/unblu-middleware-lib[unblu middleware library].

It:

- Automatically creates a bot registration
- Automatically creates a webhook registration
- Correctly handles all webhooks and pings (lib handles that)
- Correctly handles all bot outbound requests and pings (lib handles that)
- Accepts all visitor onboarding offers
- Greets a visitor when the dialog is open
- Echos all visitor messages
- Logs all messages, not just in a bot dialog (the webhook handler is set up to do so)
